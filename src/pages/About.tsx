            🔍 Where others see chaos, I see patterns. Where most shy away from uncertainty, I see an opportunity to analyze, quantify, and influence outcomes.

            My journey into data science didn't start with a textbook — it started with a love for probability, the math of possibility, and a desire to solve real-world problems.
            💡 Since then, I've explored fintech, business intelligence, and risk analytics — always striving to make data not just usable, but understandable.

              📁 I built master tables from scratch, helped financial veterans embrace new workflows, and designed systems so intuitive they became second nature.

            <p>🛠️ With hands-on experience in SQL, Python, Power BI, and a background in risk assessment, A/B testing, and UI design, I've delivered insights that:</p>
            <ul className="mt-2 space-y-1 ml-4">
              <li>✅ Reduced losses</li>
              <li>✅ Accelerated decisions</li>
              <li>✅ Boosted retention</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">And when needed? I've gone manual — parsing handwritten records and perfecting dashboards until they feel just right.</p>

            🎓 Now, I'm pursuing my MSc in Data Science at the University of Leeds, diving deeper into research and machine learning — areas I've long admired (and finally decided to master).

            <p className="mt-2">That mindset flows into my work too:</p>

            ⚽🏐🏀 I'm also a huge sports fan — mainly football, volleyball & basketball.
            I captained the first school teams in all three, helping build some of the strongest squads in South Tamil Nadu, and later played university-level volleyball pre-COVID.
            Being captain wasn't just about wins; it taught me how to lead, bounce back, back my team, and keep energy high no matter the score.
